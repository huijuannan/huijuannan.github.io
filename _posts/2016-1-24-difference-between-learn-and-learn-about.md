>这周做的翻译里的一句话：
>Note that the title above isn’t “how to learn everything”, but “how to learn about everything”. The distinction I have in mind is between knowing the inside of a topic in deep detail — many facts and problem-solving skills — and knowing the structure and context of a topic: essential facts, what problems can be solved by the skilled, and how the topic fits with others.

这里涉及到两个词的区别`learn`和`learn from`。

google了一下发现，区别还是很大的。

有人给出的解释是这样的：

>I am learning Japanese. = I am studying the language. I want to speak, read, and write the language. 
>I am learning about Japanese. = I am becoming informed about the features of the language. For example, that it has more than one alphabet and that it uses Chinese characters, too. 

也就是说，`learn`的意思就是它的本意，即学某一件事，比如，学日语。而`learn about`的意思，去了解跟某一概念相关的相关的信息，比如，了解日语的字母是由一些中文字符组成。

另一个解释是:

>To learn about something is to become aware that it exists and to know something of its history and/or its uses or other characteristics; to learn something is to actually acquire the ability to something.

同样地，`learn about`是了解某件事情的历史或者它的用处以及其他一些属性。而`learn`就是真的掌握一件事。
